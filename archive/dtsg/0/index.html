<title>Nothing Is Happening</title>

<p>It's 1AM and it's RAINING. I like rain. I like 1AM but it also makes me tired which isn't something I like so much.
<br>what I do like, however, is the strange sense of ETERNITY that follows 1AM around like some sort of TIME STALKER.
<br>It is calm and quiet. Nothing is happening. Just the rain and the dark. One comfortable, consistent moment stretched out until dawn.
<br>I have decided that RIGHT NOW, at 1AM, while listening to the rain, I need to make a website.</p>
<p>It doesn't need to be GOOD</p>
<p>It doesn't need to have PURPOSE</p>
<p>It just needs to EXIST</p>
<p>and so exist it is. does. is doing. has been doing. will continue to do after you leave.
<br>It exists and it has PARAGRAPHS with WORDS and some of those words are in ALL CAPS because it's just that kind of night.</p>
<p>It's 3AM and it's RAINING. It is calm and quiet. Nothing is happening. Just the rain and the dark.
<br>Essentially what I have here is a blog. But instead of multiple posts, it's just one post that gets overwritten every few weeks.
<br>Maybe if you check back in a few weeks there'll be something else here. Something more complex.
<br>Then there'll be something even more complex. And so on until the site doesn't resemble a blog post at all.
<br>Maybe it'll look like <a href="http://www.the3gi.com/">this</a>... No, probably not.
<br>For now this is a web page with words. Which is still a good way to convey information
<br>such as <a href="http://consc.net/misc/moser.html">this story by David Moser</a>, or <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jhclark/insult.htm">whatever this is</a>.</p>
<p>It's 4AM and it's RAINING. I like rain. I could sit and listen to it all night.
<br>It's calm here. It's nice. Nothing is happening. Just the rain and the dark.
<br>I'm playing a game of <a href="https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Calvinball">Calvinball</a>. I could have thought this through, but I have a tendency to overthink. Starting a simple game of calvinball gets things moving quicker.
<br>I'd like to play more calvinball with my projects in 2021. Then I might have some content to display on this site.</p>
<p>It's 5AM and it's stopped raining. Nothing is happening.
<br>Wonder if I'll have any wacky dreams.</p>
