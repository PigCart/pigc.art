				<p>This is really irritating and needs to stop happening, which is why I've revived my old neocities page to start a daily microblog. How will this help? it probably won't. It might even make it worse. I can barely make Duolingo a daily habit so giving myself another task to do each day seems a tad futile. But hey, who knows? Maybe if I'm actively keeping track of each day I'll be more inclined to get my arse in gear.<br> Alternatively... it is currently 3AM tomorrow morning, which for some reason seems to always be the time when I end up making websites that I abandon after a week or so. I might just be doing that again. I don't know.</p>

			</header>
				<p>Starting these posts is difficult. Starting coursework is difficult. Starting to go to bed is difficult. So I procrastinate on all these things which does nothing but delay the next thing I need to start. None of these are actually difficult tasks, so there's no reason starting them should be such a federal fucking issue.<br>
				I sculpted a hand in blender today. Better than yesterday I guess, but not nearly enough progress considering this is for coursework due in a few days.</p>

				<span class="weekday">Saturday</span><h2>Began to add fur to my lil sculpt.</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I'm using some free brush "alphas" from CG Boost. Alphas is a stupid name because the textures don't have anything to do with transparency nor do they use the alpha channel of the image.
			As far as I can tell they're just bogstandard heightmaps.<br>
			I had sculpted some rough clothes, but I removed them today because they look dumb. I'll redo them as a cloth simulation tomorrow, after I've finished the sculpting and retopologized the model.
			I'm putting a lot of faith into tomorrow-me and I REALLY hope they'll cooperate.</p>
