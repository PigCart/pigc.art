			</header>
			<p>I spent way too much time tinkering with the CSS for this page. I did however discover the <a href="https://github.com/the3dadvantage/MC_29">Modelling Cloth</a> addon, which feels a little easier to use than Blender's default cloth simulation. Still, sewing clothes is actually quite difficult to get right even in a simulation. I think it mostly relies on getting the right shapes to sew together. tried looking at some diagrams but I'm no tailor so they just look like nonsense to me. I'll play around with it some more tomorrow morning.</p>

				<span class="weekday">Sat</span><h2>The Modelling Cloth addon didn't help.</h2>
			</header>
			<p>It just made things more complicated. Clothing simulations are frustrating. It's quite difficult to guage what the shape, proportions and topology of the cloth pieces should look like. I managed to sucessfully create something resembling a ballet dress, but when returning to the business suit I was trying to make, I could still only yield nothing but a scrunched up mess of fabric.<br>
			It might be worth trying to work backwards. If I copy the character mesh and form the suit pieces from that, in theory the resulting suit should be in a shape that fits nicely around the character without weirdness. Failing that I'll just do a crappy manual job and move on because I'm spending way too much time on this.</p>

				<span class="weekday">Sun</span><h2>Copying the character mesh does make the cloth sim easier.</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Although because the cloth already conforms to the character's shape, it doesn't end up making many nice folds and wrinkles. That's kinda ok though since I'm making a suit and they're usually sort of firm anyway. I picked a frame from early on in the simulation where the cloth is still turbulent which is good enough. Both the shirt and suit have now been simulated and baked. Did a crappy manual job for the tie and shirt collar, those tend to not be so wrinkly.<br>
			I'll go back through these posts and add some images at some point.</p>

				<span class="weekday">Mon</span><h2>Feels like I should have gotten further than I have.</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I made some teeth, but they're extremely approximate - each tooth literally 3 cubes stuck together - the subsurf modifier did the heavy lifting. It shouldn't have taken more than an hour but it did. I made a low poly version of the suit, but that only required deleting some geometry and pressing the unsubdivide button. It shouldn't have taken more than an hour but it did. I set up texture paint and prepared a project for the video edit, but come on that so basic it's barely worth mentioning. Shouldn't have taken more than an hour... I don't remember if I did anything else. Do I just waste my time tending to details so small and insignificant that as soon as I look away I forget them entirely? I feel like that might be the case. Gotta stop that. Very annoying.</p>

			<p>I don't want that to be the case. I really hope it's not that. That would mean that it's out of my control entirely. It least when something is my fault I can work towards rectifying the issue. Today: I've scripted, recorded, and have started editing this project's development video. I also finished the clothing materials. They just need baking. But I still feel like it should be possible to do way more in a day, so where's the bottleneck? Perhaps I'm still focusing on minor details too much. Difficult habit to break.</p>

			<p>What does that even meaaaan? It means today is deadline day and the project I've been working on, that I will now refer to as the dogman project, has been submitted. Although I've the model is technically complete there's still a bunch of extra stuff I wanted to do, such as rigging. I intend to continue working on it but for now I'm pushing it to the back of my mind so I can focus on the last project still in coursework territory which I'll talk about tomorrow.<br><br>
			Also hey! It's been almost two weeks since I started this blog thing and I haven't gotten bored yet. Whether writing each day down like this is actually helpful to me or just another distraction is yet to be seen. There's plenty of reasons that could make it one or the other. It could even be equally helpful and distracting. Dunno where that would leave me!</p>

				<span class="weekday">Thu</span><h2>I have 2 weeks to make a complicated game.</h2>
			</header>
			<p>That's like a game jam on steroids and so far every game jam I've attempted has been a total failure. Welcome to the Chronologuard Project. Chronologuard is a VR-PC co-op game about clearing the void of the temporal shadows left by the time travelling fools who were unfortunate enough to paradox themselves into oblivion. I started working on this 4 MONTHS ago. I'm not really sure how I've ended up with only two weeks left. Luckily I have decent modelling skills and a solid foundational knowledge of basic programming concepts so I think I might just be able to pull a miracle out of my arse.<br>
			Today I finished up the logic for the PC player pawn and logged 11 bugs to fix later if I have time. Finishing the PC pawn was easy since the only thing I needed to do was set up the deploy mechanic and its menu functionality. I had already designed the menu and the deploy system is just an extension of the building system which I had also already done, so no problems there. Tomorrow I want to get the VR player working. Unreal Engine already provides a functional VR pawn, the difficult part will be getting it networked. Last time I tried to run it in multiplayer mode it broke in unexpected ways, so I have that to look forward to.</p>

			<p>I just checked the replicate checkboxes and apparently that was all that was needed. There is still some weirdness with the view wobbling but that might just be an issue with the editor. I Guess I'll find out once I package the first iteration of the game in a few days. I was supposed to have set up the inventory system today but I spent too long faffing around. Shouldn't be much hassle since the inventory is actually made up of physical objects kinda like how <i>Astroneer</i> does it. The difficult part will be figuring out how to display it in an intuitive way when the player wants to access their stuff. Might be easiest to reuse the procedural grid blueprint from the building system.</p>

			<p>you can put objects into an inventory card! Yes, objects. Plural objects. Those cards just eat em up with no concern for conservation of mass. You also can't take anything out of the cards again, nor can you hold all your cards in front of you, which is what I was talking about yesterday. The images of the objects in the cards don't sync in multiplayer either. Argh I have so much left to do of this system that I wanted to have finished yesterday.</p>

				<span class="weekday">Sun</span><h2>I freaking love programming BUT DAMN...</h2>
			</header>
			<p>When something goes wrong it goes REALLY wrong. The reason the card images weren't syncing is because actor references become null when passed to the client even though the docs say they're networked by the engine. Maybe I misunderstood something? and THEN I spent a few hours trying to figure out why an equals node was always returning false. I gave up on that and converted everything to strings and compared those instead. AND THEEEN I plugged a node into the wrong place which took another hour or so to figure out. So the inventory system still isn't finished and I'm going to cry myself to sleep now. Ok maybe not, but it's still kind of disheartening to see how long this is taking. Hopefully I can pick up the pace tomorrow now that I at least have the cards themselves done.</p>
			<p>I'm going to start shoving images into these posts. I want to do CSS stuff to have them float around at the sides but eh there's no way I'll get around to that soon so they'll stay inline for now.

					<span class="weekday">Tue</span><h2>I didn't really think multiplayer sessions through.</h2>
				</header>
				<p>I likely glossed over it in my mind because the original concept of this project, before it become Chronologuard, was much simpler. Initially I think I was just going to use <abbr title="Universal Plug and Play">UPNP</abbr> to port forward. Then in unreal engine it's pretty much just 2 blueprint nodes for opening the server and connecting. However, now that I'm doing this for coursework I need it to actually work on campus, which means no port forwarding. So I had to figure out how to use Steam's networking service thingy. That turned out to be really easy because there's a plugin that does all the hard work for me. Yay! Although it still took the whole day to realize the default session stuff wasn't going to work and then look through the alternatives and then look into wether I could even use steam and then find the plugin and the try and implement it on top of what I already had and then figure out why it's not working and bluuuuh. On top of that I don't seem to be able to package the game to send it to someone to test with. I migrated everything to a new project but that just made the errors more vague so I'll have to melt my brains on this tomorrow. I'm itching to continue working on the actual game but I keep getting held back by all these boring parts.</p>

					<span class="weekday">Wed</span><h2>I've been up to my eyeballs in this weird puzzle shit all day.</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The reason the project wasn't packaging properly is because I had the "RawInput" plugin disabled, which is apparently needed by advanced sessions (the plugin that does the steam stuff for me). No idea why there isn't a simple error message for that. I'd probably have a better time reading an ancient tome written in old norse than I would trying to wrangle my meaty think sack around the nonsensical cacaphony in the build logs. When I finally got a working build packaged the main menu was mostly off screen. This turned out to be the result of it trying to render in VR when the headset is disabled via blueprints. I don't know why I didn't run into this issue before. I'm pretty sure the menu was fine yesterday. Next on the to-do-list-of-things-to-do is fixing steam sessions. They work in-editor but not in the packaged build. Or maybe they do? Hosting seems to work. Joining just fails and the plugin doesn't seem to offer any errors so I'll have to dig through the logs.<br>
				These things feel like such small issues which is why it feels so crushing when I end up spending the whole day dealing with them.</p>

						<span class="weekday">Thu</span><h2>Got a bit distracted today.</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Lost focus this morning and as usual found it difficult to get back on track. Whoops! there goes that day. Dang.<br>
					Anyway, the past is far behind us and the future doesn't exist so let's look at the present:</p>
					<h3>ChronoloGuard progress update</h3>
					<p>The base game is almost complete! Steam online sessions were working all along. I think the issue before is that I was using the same steam account for both game instances. After making a second account I was then able to connect to an instance of the game running from my main account. Woo! To make sure it was definitely working I got Newt to play test it with me. Noticed a couple of bugs to add to my issue tracker but those all seem to be simple oversights I can easily fix later. That means everything is FINALLY working as intended and I can move on to adding ACTUAL CONTENT to the game.</p>
						<img src="2022-05-19.gif">
					<h3>Meta notes</h3>
					<p>The CSS theming for this page looks more like how I initially imagined it now. I'm not sure if I like it really. And for some reason the transitions don't work. I'm also trying out breaking the posts down into sections. A little nicer to look at than just a single big paragraph and it'll make it easier to make the site more modular with <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> if I feel like doing that, which I may do if I continue over the summer.</p>

						<span class="weekday">Fri</span><h2>What just happened. The day is over. where did it go.</h2>
					</header>
					<p>In all seriousness I guess I got super distracted today, but when I try to recall exactly why my mind comes up blank. I started modelling some machines today for ChronoloGuard. One of the inspirations for the machines is this wacky record lathe or whatever it actually is:</p>
					<img src="2022-05-20.jpg">
					<p>I've been trying to simplify the designs a lot but that's clearly not working well enough so I'm going to ban myself from doing any modelling that isn't basically just a bunch of little cubes. That way it'll be impossible to get bogged down in the details.</p>

						<span class="weekday">Sat</span><h2>Steady progress has resumed. Slow, but steady.</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						I've set up one of the three Cs of ChronoloGuard. Crafting. At least I think I have. I did all the blueprints in one go and haven't gotten very far in testing it yet. The original plan for the crafting system was for it to be partially procedural, where I make a bunch of meshes and then reuse them but with the stats and material swapped out. So if there were 5 objects in the level with 5 different materials, you could use them to make 25 slightly differing objects.<br>
						However, Setting up a system like that sounds like a pain in the arse, so I'm going to hardcode all the crafting recipes instead. I'd prefer to have 5 interesting craftable objects over having 25 dull ones anyway.
					</p>
					<h3>Meta thoughts</h3>
					<p>I like the concept of the CSS theme I was going for but I hate my execution of it. I thought if I left it a few days it'd grow on me, but no. Definitely going to do something else for next month's page. I have a few ideas.</p>

					<p>Spent most of the day tripping over my nodes and getting all tangled up in them. I'm 80% sure it all works now though. I intended to move on to the second of the three Cs today; combat. Then I got sidetracked by tweaking the building system. Somehow, at some point, I had convinced myself that it was pretty much done, but noo it needs so much more tweaking. Things are still colliding incorrectly with the building tiles, it's only possible to make fully enclosed rooms with no enterance or exit, and there's no checks for whether you're placing objects in valid positions. The building system is useless in this state.<br>
					Tomorrow I really need to build the base level itself, fill it with stuff, and then add some crafting recipes that use the stuff. At Newt's request I already added a specific recipe. Combining a canister of explosive gas with a potato will create... A GUN! Yeah the crafting system is kind of abstract.</p>

The most notable one being the fact that the floor tiles don't even connect to the regular building tiles because literally as I'm writing this I just realized the floor tiles aren't calling the update functions of the neighbouring tiles. Do I have a brick for a brain. How did I forget to call the update function. Still, the second most notable issue is that the collision for the tiles is more messed up than I thought so I'll just have to trust that the built in navigation system will work properly once I fix the collision. Then I'll be able to get the combat set up, which is the last main system needed for the game to be technically playable from start to finish. I should have done it first really.<br>

					<p>14 Hours remain. Well okay, night of the penultimate day. But saying the other thing sounds less clunky and more cool. The three Cs of ChronoloGuard are all working! Mostly! The three Cs are the systems the VR player interacts with. Combat, Currency, and Crafting. The PC Player gets to use the two Bs: The Building system, and the Buttload of nothing because there's no time to do anything else. I did manage to fix the collisions for the building system stuff. The issue was that a bunch of things were using the wrong objectType. A simple and easy to fix issue that could have been entirely avoided had I set up some custom collision types and channels when I started and stuck to consistently using them. Tomorrow I'll write an overview thingy for how this project went, after I finish polishing this turd of course.

						<span class="weekday">Wed</span><h2>I made a complicated game in 2 weeks. How did I do?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						It went about as well as expected. I got the base game working by the skin of my teeth, which is a really weird phrase because now I'm picturing a tooth wearing a hoodie made of skin. Instead of getting totally distracted by this train of thought, let me summarize what the original concept for this game was. Some time ago I decided it would be cool to make a Virtual Reality thingymabob that I could chuck a load of random mechanics into as a way to get more familiar with Unreal Engine and also as a way to attempt to justify the impulse selling of my soul to Mark Zuck-on-deez-nutz-erberg. I decided to use my last coursework assignment this year as an excuse to work on this, as the assignment itself was pretty open ended. However, that meant that it needed to be somewhat coherent, so the original idea kind of fell apart and I picked up some of the pieces to create ChronoloGuard instead. As I mentioned previously: "Chronologuard is a VR-PC co-op game about clearing the void of the temporal shadows left by the time travelling fools who were unfortunate enough to paradox themselves into oblivion." The VR player is tasked with navigating the level, finding and crafting weapons, and collecting currency by slaying enemies. The PC player gets to see all this from a birds eye view. Their job is to help by altering the level layout, thereby controlling the flow of enemies.<br>
						Considering I only gave myself 2 weeks to do all this, I think I succeeded in my goal of "pulling a miracle out of my arse". The one constantly recurring issue was collision. I set up a collision channel for the building grid, but not for anything else. I guess I thought it wasn't necessary? It absolutely was necessary. Especially for a VR game where the interactions are more likely to be more physical thereby relying more on checking for hits and overlaps. My improperly configured collision affected the building tile updates, building placement, enemy pathfinding, VR teleporting, and even the crafting system. Such a headache!<br>
						Towards the end I was just shoving workarounds for collision and other stuff on top of the existing stuff. This was the second biggest issue. The classes became unweildy, unreadable, and super tangled up. I don't think I could remove or significantly change one part of the game without several other things mysteriously exploding. Should be using interfaces and proper referencing instead of the 500 casts and custom events I have now. The last main issue is that I probably should have given myself more than two weeks because that was unnecessarily stressful. I'll figure out this "time" thing someday.

						I probably won't do that again. At the moment some stuff is kind of difficult to write about because I started this right at the end of all the current things I've been doing. In fact I've purposefully not been adding much context to anything because then everything would be 3 times longer and I'd be here all day trying to explain away the echoes of eternal idiocy.<br>
						After going ham in <abbr title="Unreal Engine 4">UE4</abbr> for 2 weeks my brain juice is totally spent, so I didn't really work on anything today. I thought alot about all the things I could be doing though. Choice paralysis.

					<p>
						I had intended to work on a second version of this blog today but got sidetracked by looking at all the tutorials, tips, and general reference material on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a>... and also I've been mostly sitting around in the sun and sneezing all day because hayfever or something. I appreciate the variety the seasons bring but I'd rather take the cosiness of winter over this.<br>
						Anyway, the reason I'd like to make a "second version" of the blog is so I can move all the posts into a searchable tag based system. As always I'm super overthinking it and should really stop thinking and just do something even if it turns out to be terrible. That's like the whole point of having this site. I'm not supposed to think I'm just supposed to do. That's how I ended up with this terrible calendar theme. I hate it but at least it's something.</p>

						<span class="weekday">Sat</span><h2>Hello [object Object] my old friend...</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						I've started making the tag system and have actually already got it working! Here's how it works:<br>
						<b>1)</b> Each post is an article element with a data attribute called "tags" that contains all the tags for the post.<br>
						<b>2)</b> The search page has a javascript function that takes a file (this page) and a query (the tag you're searching).<br>
						<b>3)</b> When run, it gets the html from the file and gets every article that has a data attribute containing a tag that matches the query.<br>
						<b>4)</b> Finally, it loops through the collection of articles it found and adds them all to the page.<br>
						<br>
						The only problem with this is that for it to work for every post it has to load every page all at once. So eventually loading is going to be pretty slow if I continue for long enough, which I might! I've been kinda enjoying this lil daily project.

						<span class="weekday">Sun</span><h2>I realize I'm probably the spookiest thing in the woods right now.</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						Demands are made. A friend is pursued. The path ahead of you curves around a tree and disappears under a wall of black cast down by the thick summer canopy. You once again request to be handed the wallet as you follow your friend around the corner, and then the both of you freeze, argument forgotten, for a noise has erupted from the darkness before you. A hound-like creature emerges, staggering forward at middling speed as if held back by something, which it is. That something then appears too, a tall shadowy figure, clutching the rope restraining the creature with a bony hand. The hound barks again and the figure growls a single word, as if responding, which it is.<br>
						"Luna..."<br>
						"Oh crap", you think. "This it it", you think. "The Grim Reaper just whispered some bullshit moon incantation and is here to claim my soul."<br>
						You stop flipping the fuck out because you are now the shadowy figure a few moments prior. You can hear two rowdy voices floating through the air, but the trees echo and mask the sound, obscuring its true origin. Your professional opinion is that this is pretty spooky. Then you happen upon them. Their loud discussion regarding money upsets your dog, who strongly believes that societies' monetary system should run on belly rubs. She decides to share her views with them via a sharp yap. At this the two previously boisterous fellows fall quiet, having only just noticed your presence. They stand aside as you pass, and one of them offers an apology and notes how your arrival scared them. You realize you're probably the spookiest thing in the woods right now.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: 10px;">(Nothing really happened today so I figured I'd write a narrative thingy. Some exaggeration may be at play ;]. And okay, yes, I acknowledge the dog is the one doing the spookums here, not me. I just found it funny how in this moment I managed to facilitate a spook, as anyone who knows me IRL can attest that I am indeed one of the least spookiest people alive.)</p>

					<header><span class="weekday">Mon</span><h2>I no longer hate this page.</h2></header>
					<p>Turns out the thing making me hate this page was that everything shifted around and got super uneven when you hovered over a post to expand it. I'm now setting the post content to absolute position when you hover over it, which means it detaches from the regular flow of the page, and therefore doesn't make the other posts shift around. That, as well as adding shadows, highlighting, and other minor tweaks, makes the page nicer to interact with. Still not sure why the transitions don't work though, and I'm still changing the theme next month anyway. I don't like the posts being popups and everything is far too neat and orderly. This isn't bloody twitter, get this sterile order outta here! I want to go ham with my css!</p>
					<p>The tag filter view post search thingy is also pretty much done. Since it plonks every page into the same document I had to fix the css for each page overriding everything, which is easily doable by adding a page-specific selector to each css rule. I kinda jumped the gun making this as there's really no need for it at the moment.</p>

					<p>
						Somehow Firefox is the only browser that was displaying this page properly so I almost missed this, but other browsers freak out if you don't leave spaces around operators so all the posts were zero width since the width of the inner post content was <code>calc(var(--post-width)-50px)</code>. None of the css validators I tried picked up on this! In fact, one of them just yelled about organizing the css rules alphabetically. who the fuck cares about ordering css alphabetically.</p>
					<p>
						The CSS for the search page wasn't actually working at all. I was just leaving it in the hidden element and assuming it was fine, but it wasn't fine because I set <code>.innerHTML</code> on that element for every page I grab posts from which overrides everything in it. I tried to make it append each page instead of overwriting, but I have a poor understanding of object types and kept running into errors. Speaking of object type errors, my solution was to grab and insert the css element thingy like I do with the posts, but this also causes an error while simultaneously working fine. Schrödinger's error! Since I don't understand object types I therefore don't count as an observer and can get both an error and working code at the same time! hell yeah this is definitely how quantum physics works.</p>
					<p>
						Anyway, new page tomorrow! New theme! New spooky foggy picture of road! I'm never going to run out of those. I practically live at the spooky road factory.
