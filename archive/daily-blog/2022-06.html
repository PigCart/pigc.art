                <p>Bye, old calendar layout. You were terrible.</p>
                <h2>Goals for the month</h2>
                <ul><li>Finish what I started</li></ul>
                <ul><li>Something else...?</li></ul>
                <ul><li>Forgot what it was</li></ul>
                <ul><li>Probably not important</li></ul>
                <p>This month I'm going to focus on the big pile of unfinished projects I have. Luckily I have forgotten what half of them were, which makes things a bit easier.</p>
                <p>First thing I can tick off the list: finishing this sites search function. Which isn't actually for searching. Not in the typical sense, like Google or Ecosia. It's just how I'm going to implement categories. I rewrote it and now all the bugs are gone, including Schr√∂dinger's error from yesterday. Yay!</p>

                        <h2>The Mystery Of The Rifts</h2>
                        <p>Essentially, it's a Minecraft prank video in which I control two player characters who both appear to have the same username and skin. You cannot tell them apart. I enhanced this by making them both move around and speak into proximity chat at the same time. The idea was to go and visit some people and see how much confusion I could cause. It got a bit more narratively involved than I had anticipated though.<br>
                        I started working on this last year, september 18, so it's been almost a year in production, but I've had to ignore it for most of that time to focus on coursework instead. Usually I would ditch a video project if it's been left for a couple months but this one I've put too much work into to just throw away like that. Since it <i>has</i> been left so long though, I don't remember what's actually missing or what's been intentionally left out. It's taking a while to figure out where I'm at and how to move forward.</p>

                        <p>Therefore I don't really want to stop. One of the best ways to learn is to make something terrible. And I'm sure doing that. Actually that would make for a good summary of the whole thing. I might put it on the front page later. Currently it just redirects to the latest page, here.<br>It's 3am. I'm going to get some hot chocolate.</p>

                        <h2>Going to lay down some rules on how I run this blog.</h2>
                        <p>Firstly, there will be no speculative posting. That means no writing about things I might do or am planning to do. Not until they actually happen and start existing and I have something to actually report on. The future is unfathomable, despite how much we try to fathom it anyway!</p>
                        <p>Secondly, and I mentioned this at the end of last month, supplying context is absolutely out the window. I'm often tempted to justify a decision or explain the process of how I ended up doing something, but most of the time all that doesn't matter and isn't that interesting.</p>
                        <p>Finally, although daily is the goal, I don't want to be forcing it like I've been doing so far. From now on updates will only be posted if progress has actually been made. No more 3am posting about hot chocolate or whatever... Anyway, it's 3am I'm going to get some hot chocolate.</p>

                        <h2>It's been a meandering week</h2>
                        <p>6 days since the last post. I forget how much my mental stability relies on routine, even if it was just for two days a week. Now that uni is done for a while, and the routine has been pulled out from under me, I've been left feeling kind of wack.
                        <p>Not much progress made on this dang video. Editing old footage sucks! I've moved on, everyone in the video has moved on, the core potential viewers have moved on. But still, I want to see the final product and nobody else is going to make that happen. Main thing I would like to have done differently is how I organised the recording sessions. I did everyone individually, which is making the video really drag on. I should have tried to group people up instead. That would make the video snappier and allow their personalities to bounce off each other. I have at least edited those sections now, just have the gameshow section to do. I'm expecting the final thing to end up at around 45 minutes long so I probably will have to do a second pass to trim the fat. Fucking feature length minecraft let's play. Sheesh.</p>

                        <h2>Finally rid of it</h2>
                        <p>I ultimately decided to split the rift video in half. The gameshow segment will be it's own thing. Managed to get the rest of it down to 28 minutes which isn't too bad.<br>
                        What made this so long and frustrating was that each recording session was... well, an entire session. About an hour of footage per person on average. Gathering people together for the recordings would have been better in literally every way, I'm astounded that past me continually did it this way instead. The rest of the unfinished videos will go down really smoothly in comparison. I won't write about them because that would be boring and cringe.<br>
                        <p>I only had a vague idea of what the page layout here would look like after I exploded the calendar, so a few days ago I flipped through the Neocities browse page for inspiration. The highlights were <a href="https://hog.neocities.org">hog.neocities.org</a> and <a href="http://archives.somnolescent.net/web/mari_nc2/essays/revisitingpassion.html">this link</a> I found to a post that despises sites like the former. I love the web.</p>

                            <h2>Returning to Minecraft Modding</h2>
                            <p>With the big video out of the way and the first Hearthcraft meetup rapidly approaching, I figured now is a good time to update my mods to 1.19. Someone was nice enough to PR a bugfix and update for my auto port forwarding thingy, which I've submitted to curseforge and modrinth. It's always nice to put something out there that someone feels is valuable enough to spend their own time on.<br>
                            Last time I touched modding was in February so I spent most of the time figuring out why my dev env was completely broken instead of actually working on my mods. Oh well.</p>
                            <p>Every so often I come across two mods that go together like Mayonnaise and Pinapple Pizza, which is to say thay're absolutely fucking delicious together. Unfortunately often the two mods in question are incompatible with each other. This time it's MCXR, which enables the use of VR, and Iris, which enables the use of shaders. Nothing is more immersive and visually appealing than some sweet path traced lighting. Can't have it in VR though! Bah!<br>
                            It's things like this that make my mind wander over to the possibility of making a minecraft client in unreal engine. The minecraft server can handle all the gameplay stuff, and I'll be free to add whatever inputs or graphical changes I want using all the marketplace assets, third-party plugins, and janky blueprint nodes I can get my hands on. When I started this blog, documenting dumbass ridiculous projects like this was what I had in mind.</p>
